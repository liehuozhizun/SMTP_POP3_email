# POP3-email
## Project Description
* This project is trying to develop an email service with basic functionalities implemented based on the basic POP3 client-server model and multi-threading thinking. All functionalities are implemented by ourselves, including the standard POP3 protocol.  
* This project is a cooperative one completely developed and managed by Yujia Li and Hang Yuan.
